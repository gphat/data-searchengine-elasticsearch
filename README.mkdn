# DESCRIPTION

Data::SearchEngine::ElasticSearch is a backend for Data::SearchEngine.  It
aims to generalize the features of [ElasticSearch](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?ElasticSearch) so that application
authors are insulated from _some_ of the differences betwene search modules.

# IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

This module is opinionated. ElasticSearch's query language and features are
powerful and difficult to reign in.  Therefore this module has taken some
steps to bring things toward a more central feature set.

## Incomplete

ElasticSearch's query DSL is large and complex.  It is not well suited to
abstraction by a library like this one.  As such you will almost likely find
this abstraction lacking.  Expect it to improve as the author uses more of
ElasticSearch's features in applications.

## Resultes

The `_index` and `_version` keys will both be populated in the returned
[Data::SearchEngine::Item](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Data::SearchEngine::Item).

## Explanations

Setting `debug` to a true value will cause <explain> to be set when the query
is sent to ElasticSearch.  You can find the explanation by examining the
`raw` attribute of the [Data::SearchEngine::Results](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Data::SearchEngine::Results) object.

## Queries

It is expected that if your [Data::SearchEngine::Query](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Data::SearchEngine::Query) object has __any__
`query` set then it must also have a `type`.

The query is then passed on to [ElasticSearch](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?ElasticSearch) thusly:

    $es->search(
        # ...
        query => { $query->type => $query->query }
        # ...
    );

So if you want to do a query_string query, you would set up your query like
this:

    my $query = Data::SearchEngine::Query->new(
        # ...
        type => 'query_string',
        query => { query => 'some query text' }
        # ...
    );

See the documents for
[ElasticSearch's DLS](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/query-dsl/)
for more details.

## Indexing

ElasticSearch wants an `index` and `type` for each Item that is indexed. It
is expected that you will populate these values in the item thusly:

  my $item = Data::SearchEngine::Item->new(
    id => $something,
    values => {
        index => 'twitter',
        type => 'tweet',
        # and whatever else
    }
  );
  $dse->add($item);

## Filters

If you set multiple filters they will be ANDed together.  If you want to change
this behavior then you can change the `filter_combiner` attribute to "or".

## Facets & Filters

If you use facets then any filters will be copied into the facet's
`facet_filter` so that the facets are limited similarly to the results.

# ATTRIBUTES

## filter_combiner

Boolean used to combine filters. Should be either "and" or "or". Defaults to
and.

## servers

The servers to which we'll be connecting.

## transport

The transport to use.  Refer to [ElasticSearch](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?ElasticSearch) for more information.

# METHODS

## add ([ $items ])

Add items to the index.  Keep in mind that the [Data::SearchEngine::Item](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Data::SearchEngine::Item)
should have values set for [index](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?index) and [type](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?type).

## engine

Returns the underlying ElasticSearch implementation.

## present ($item)

Returns true if the [Data::SearchEngine::Item](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Data::SearchEngine::Item) is present.  Uses the item's
`id`.

## remove_by_id ($item)

Remove the specified item from the index.  Uses the item's `id`.

## search ($query)

Search!

## find_by_id ($index, $type, $id)

Find a document by it's unique id.
